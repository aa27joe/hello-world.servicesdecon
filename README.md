# hello-world.servicesdecon
I am trying to build a web services company where the nodes/ servers are decentralized i wanna build it in a way where third parties can add services and functions to the service and normal people can be the servers this way there will be more nodes in the ecosystem and those who run websites will get incentives i need avid programmers , networking engineers and people from cyber security to help me in this journey it will give people privacy and no single company even us can take them on i have an idea for a marketplace within this ecosystem where our customers will be able to sell whatever data they want to advertisers in order to make a quick buck.
My name is Ashwath Athreya and i belive having decentralised servers where the commmmon man has access to it no big company wouls have control over you website and if this movemment gains traction it could be revolutionary
